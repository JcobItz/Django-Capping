# Django Capping

Using the admin interface you can create surveys, add questions of various types and give questions choices. The front-end survey view then automatically populates based on the questions that have been defined in the admin interface.

Submitted responses can also be viewed via the admin backend graphically, or textually and can be exported as a .csv or .xls file.
